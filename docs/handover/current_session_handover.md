## Purpose Of This Document

This is the restart trace for the next session. Keep this document updated whenever the working direction, completed foundation, next step, or open risk changes.

If the computer/session restarts, start here first, then run:

```powershell
cd D:\Tools\Stock_Screener_V3
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline --decorate -8
$env:PYTHONPATH='D:\Tools\Stock_Screener_V3\src'
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Expected status at this handover:

```text
## main...origin/main
```

Expected tests at this handover:

```text
28 tests passing
```

## Current Decision

Do not continue tuning the old V2 Crossover monolith.

V3 is a clean rebuild that should preserve the useful V2 operating model, output visibility, and validation discipline while rebuilding the engine logic with cleaner module boundaries.

The actual production signal engine/stage evaluators are not yet implemented.

## Completed Groundwork

Documentation and architecture:

- Fresh program charter.
- V2 gap analysis against the fresh charter.
- V3 initial analysis and way-forward plan.
- V3 module contracts.
- Backtesting engine requirements.
- V2 operational parity contract.
- Validation baseline acceptance pack.

Foundation code:

- Python package skeleton under `src/stock_screener_v3`.
- Core dataclasses:
  - `UniverseRecord`
  - `PriceDataBundle`
  - `EvidencePack`
  - `ScoreResult`
  - `StageEvaluation`
  - `BacktestRunConfig`
  - `BacktestResult`
- CSV universe loader with metadata preservation for mixed NSE/BSE/NYSE/NASDAQ files.
- Sector/exchange filtering.
- Deterministic sampling.
- Historical as-of slicing helpers.
- Forward-return helper.
- Backtest engine shell with pluggable price provider and stage evaluator.
- In-memory test price provider.
- Yahoo price provider wrapper.
- Detail CSV writer.
- Summary markdown writer.
- Run path and artifact helpers.
- File and console run logger with explicit close support for Windows.
- V2-compatible offline CSV column contract.
- Guardrail that log, detail CSV, and summary report must be physically separate files.
- First production Crossover evaluator slice.
- Daily evidence builder for MACD, RSI, ADX, Bollinger, EMA, volume, and price structure.
- Crossover route classifier that separates bullish transition, pullback re-entry, and continuation opportunity types.
- Reusable run orchestrator.
- CLI entry point.
- Initial Python web UI wrapper.
- Backtest outcome classification for candidate follow-through.
- Failure-category summary reporting for failed candidate follow-through.
- Candidate score-bucket summary reporting.

Tests:

- Universe loader tests.
- Backtesting utility tests.
- Backtest engine tests.
- Data provider tests.
- Report/output contract tests, including score-bucket and failure-category summaries.
- Run I/O and log artifact tests.

## Artifact Purpose Definitions

These definitions are settled and should not drift:

- Log file: execution summary report for the run.
- Output CSV: forensic calculation record for each symbol/code.
- Summary markdown: human-readable run summary.

The output CSV must preserve the V2-compatible header block first, then append V3-specific fields.

The CSV writer must emit headers even when zero candidates are found.

## What Is Not Yet Built

The actual V3 production engine logic has started but is not complete yet:

- Crossover v1 exists, but it is a first slice and needs historical calibration.
- Crossover route labels are now less overloaded, but bearish crossover routing and separate Momentum/Divergence evaluators are still not built.
- Failure categories are first-pass diagnostics and still need validation against broader historical runs.
- No production Momentum Trading evaluator.
- No production Divergence evaluator.
- No scoring calibration beyond data model contracts.
- V3 web UI exists only as an initial Python wrapper.
- CLI exists for single-date backtest execution.

## Recommended Next Session Start

Start with Crossover validation and calibration, not UI expansion.

Recommended next implementation order:

1. Continue engine architecture around stage routing, evidence, scoring, and ranking before expanding UI or validation convenience tooling.
2. Add market/sector context to the neutral evidence pack so ranking can account for broad and sector regime.
3. Build remaining Crossover directions/opportunity types, then Momentum Trading and Divergence evaluators.
4. Review failure-category counts across the validation pack and refine labels only with evidence.
5. Run fixed historical D dates with known universes to calibrate route/timing/structure/participation thresholds.

## Carry-Forward Rules

- Do not hide technical signal validity because of quality/context concerns. Use `CandidateClass`, `ReviewPriority`, and risk tags instead.
- Do not tune a rule from one stock/event.
- Do not promote signal-rule changes without a backtest report.
- Preserve sector/exchange metadata from the input universe in output rows.
- Accept mixed-market CSV inputs with NSE, BSE, NYSE, and NASDAQ codes.
- Normalize NSE symbols to `.NS` and BSE symbols to `.BO`; keep NYSE/NASDAQ unsuffixed unless `YahooSymbol` is provided.
- Preserve V2-compatible offline CSV headers.
- Keep log, output CSV, and summary report separate.
- Keep the handover document updated after every meaningful change.
